## ✅ Completed Updates

1. **Bento Design Layout** - Converted portfolio to modern Bento grid design with varied card sizes
2. **Resume Download** - Fixed resume download button (resume.pdf is in public folder)
3. **Certificate Images** - Added certificate display section (add your images to `public/certificates/`)
4. **Project Demo Links** - Added GitHub links for all 3 projects

## 📝 Action Items for You

### 1. Add Certificate Images
Add your certificate images to `public/certificates/`:
- `oracle-cloud.png` - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Certified Data Science Professional
- `aws-cloud-practitioner.png` - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

### 2. Update Project Demo Links
If you have deployed versions of your projects, update the demo URLs in `components/Projects.tsx`:

Current GitHub links:

- JobTracker: `https://github.com/riddhijain2208/JobTracker`
- FinanceFlow: `https://github.com/riddhijain2208/FinanceFlow`

If you have live demos (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), replace the `demo` URLs with your actual deployment links.

### 3. Verify Resume Download
The resume file is located at `public/resume.pdf`. Test the download button to ensure it works correctly.
