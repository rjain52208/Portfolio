# Project images (screenshots & code art)

## Option 1: App screenshots
Add one screenshot per project (e.g. from running the app locally):
- `collabspace.png` — CollabSpace
- `jobtracker.png` — JobTracker Pro  
- `financeflow.png` — FinanceFlow

Use PNG or JPG; ~1200×800px works well.

## Option 2: Code art (Carbon / code snippets)
For projects where you can’t share live UI (e.g. proprietary work), use **code snippets as art**:

1. **Create the image**
   - Go to [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh)
   - Paste a short snippet (e.g. Python ETL with `pd.merge`, a React hook, or a SQL query)
   - Pick a theme (e.g. one that matches your portfolio)
   - Export as PNG

2. **Save here**
   - Save the PNG in this folder with the right name:
     - `collabspace.png`, `jobtracker.png`, or `financeflow.png`

**Examples by project:**
- **Global Health Impact / data work:** Python/pandas (e.g. `pd.merge`, data cleaning).
- **Trading platform / Imentus:** Complex SQL or a React hook in a mockup (e.g. [Shots.so](https://shots.so) for a device frame), then export as PNG and use as project image.

When no image is found, the portfolio shows a small “code snippet” style fallback in the project card.
